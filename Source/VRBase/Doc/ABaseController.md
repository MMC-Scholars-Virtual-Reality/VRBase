# `ABaseController` Class

`ABaseController` is a concrete class which inherits from `ABaseEntity`. It defines how a VR controller works in game. It defines the teleportation mechanics, and keeps track of which buttons are pressed on the controller. You can access the left and right controllers from anywhere with `g_pLeftController` and `g_pRightController`.
