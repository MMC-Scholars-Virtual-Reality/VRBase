# `ABasePawn` Class

`ABasePawn` is a concrete class which inherits from `IBaseEntity` and `APawn`. This links the two interfaces together. Also, it works as a VR camera which also spawns instance of `ABaseController` VR controllers. It is what receives input from the user. From Unreal, you can control how your camera and controllers work from here.
