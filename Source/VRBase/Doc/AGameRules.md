# `AGameRules` Class

`AGameRules` is a concrete class derived from `ABaseEntity`. It is invisible in-game. It controls the initialization of all entities. You should extend this class to define the global rules of how your specific VR game works; use it like a level blueprint. You will need to manually place it into your level; afterwards, the global variable `g_pGameRules` can be used from anywhere in your C++ code to access it.
